# dcpd-map
Twitter application to map locations of incidents tweeted by @DCPoliceDept

Still very much a work in progress!

TODO:
* exclude media attached to tweets -- only grab text
* improve organization of tweet contents written to file
* process tweet text to only grab location information
* call Google Maps API
* post tweet with map
